# Yu-Chen_Python-Month-Identifier
The goal of this Python program is to allow the user to enter a date of form mm/dd/yyyy and display the month of the date entered (in English).

##first, it starts with "Please enter a date of form mm/dd/yyyy: ". Then the user can input the numbers with slashes.
##The program used if-elif statements to check if the format is correct or not.
##If the format is wrong, the following message will display -- "Invalid date format"
##If the format is right but the month does not have that date (example: 01/80/2023)-- then it will display "In valid day for given month".
##Otherwise, It will display the month of the date entered.
##(example: input-- 02/10/2023 output--February)
